# Cyclistic_Bike_Share
Cyclistic Bike_Share- Data analysis with SQL &amp; Power BI


## INTRODUCTION
This is the final project in my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. In this case study I will be analyzing a public dataset for a fictional company provided by the course. I will be using SQL & Power BI for this analysis. This is because SQL can handle large amount of data (5+ million rows of data in this project) very easily and Power BI is a very useful data visualization tool.

Data set for case study can be found here [Cyclistic Trip Data Download](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

## BACKGROUND INFORMATION

### Scenario

fictitiously I am wirkign as data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share compnay in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### About the company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of more than 600 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

The company's marketing strategy relied on creating general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. The flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships help the company to attract more consumers and achieve its goal.

Cyclistic refers to its customers as 'casual' rides who purchase single-ride or full-day passes and as 'members' who purchase an annual subscription.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members.


### Characters and teams

* Cyclistic:  A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

* Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

* Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.

* Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.
Consumers can purchase access to Cylictic bikes using three options:

## Ask
Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

**Moreno** (the director of marketing and my manager) has assigned me the first question to answer:

**How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**

**Key tasks**

1. Identify the business task
   
* Finding out the difference in bike use between annual members and casual riders.

2. Consider key stakeholders
- Director of Marketing & my manager (Lily Moreno), Marketing Analytics team (The team where I belong to)

**Deliverable**

**A clear statement of the business task**

For completion of the business task our effort should be answering the following questions:

- What is the total and average ride duration of the both types of users?
- What is the total and average ride duration of both types of users based on week of the day and based of the month of the year.
- What is the numbers of riders per hour for both types of users?
- What is the peak hour for both types of users?
- What are mostly used stations for both types of users?
- Which bikes are preferred  by the users?
- Between weekdays and weekend when both types of users use bikes most?


## Prepare

I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. Link for Cyclistic trip data and information about license is given above.

**Key tasks**

1. Download data and store it appropriately.
* Data has been downloaded and stored on my computer. A copy of the data has been produced to work with.

2. Identify how it’s organized.
* The data is organized in CSV (comma-separated values) format under zip file.

3. Sort and filter the data.
* For the purpose of my analysis I have downloaded most recent 12 months file (October 2022 to September 2023). Unzip those and organize those in a separate folder.

4. Determine the credibility of the data
* For the purpose of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable me to answer the business questions. But data-privacy issues will prohibit me from using rider's personally identifiable information and this will prevent me from determining if casual riders live in the
Cyclistic service area or if riders have purchased multiple single passes.

**CREATING TABLE OF 13 COLUMNS TO IMPORT DATA FROM CSV FILES TO POSTGRE SQL**

```
# CODES for creating table with ride_id as Primary Key:

CREATE TABLE october (  

ride_id VARCHAR(50),  

rideable_type TEXT,  

started_at TIMESTAMP,  

ended_at TIMESTAMP,  

start_station_name VARCHAR(100),  

start_station_id VARCHAR(100),  

end_station_name VARCHAR (100),  

end_station_id VARCHAR (100),  

start_lat DECIMAL,  

start_lng DECIMAL,  

end_lat DECIMAL,  

end_lng DECIMAL,  

member_casual TEXT,  

PRIMARY KEY (ride_id))
```


**COPY data from CSV FILE TO newly created table**

It is mentionable that in the table named 'october' we have loaded only data of october. In next step we will add rest 11 months data in this 'october' table. Then we will rename the 'october' table as 'fullyear'.

```
COPY october(ride_id, rideable_type, started_at, ended_at, start_station_name,  

start_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_id, start_lat,  start_lng, end_lat, end_lng, member_casual)  

FROM 'E:\cyclistic\202210-divvy-tripdata.csv'  # location of CSV file in computer

DELIMITER ','  

CSV HEADER  # As CSV file containes header row
```

**To view first few rows of the whole table**

```
SELECT *  

FROM october  

LIMIT 10
```

**Add November & subsequest months (11 months) data to existing table named october (This way we bring all 12 months (October 2022 to September 2023) data under 1 table)**

```
From PGadmin right click on table named October -> import/export data -> Under General from File Name,

select the CSV file -> From Options, turn on Header -> Press Ok  

# Note: This can also be done using Union All command after creating & importing data for each month's table.
```
