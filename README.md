# Cyclistic_Bike_Share
Cyclistic Bike_Share- Data analysis with SQL &amp; Power BI


## INTRODUCTION
This is the final project in my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. In this case study I will be analyzing a public dataset for a fictional company provided by the course. I will be using SQL & Power BI for this analysis. This is because SQL can handle large amount of data (5+ million rows of data in this project) very easily and Power BI is a very useful data visualization tool.

Data set for case study can be found here [Cyclistic Trip Data Download](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
