# Cyclistic_Bike_Share
Cyclistic Bike_Share- Data analysis with SQL &amp; Power BI


## INTRODUCTION
This is the final project in my Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course. In this case study I will be analyzing a public dataset for a fictional company provided by the course. I will be using SQL & Power BI for this analysis. This is because SQL can handle large amount of data (5+ million rows of data in this project) very easily and Power BI is a very useful data visualization tool.

Data set for case study can be found here [Cyclistic Trip Data Download](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).

The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

## BACKGROUND INFORMATION

### Scenario

fictitiously I am wirkign as data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share compnay in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company‚Äôs future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### About the company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of more than 600 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

The company's marketing strategy relied on creating general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. The flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships help the company to attract more consumers and achieve its goal.

Cyclistic refers to its customers as 'casual' rides who purchase single-ride or full-day passes and as 'members' who purchase an annual subscription.

Cyclistic‚Äôs finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members.
